Night in Graymore
During the ride the party discovers a ruined carriage
They follow the tracks only to discover a kenku’s nest and a prisoner within
They free the prisoner and carry him to the nearest village
Upon arrival they discovered a string of murders in the small town
They investigate and discover the murderers to be town’s lord’s assistants
They are rewarded by the old lord
And are sent with a warning “Don’t cross the Shavagons”
Before they left, Marcus (the prisoner they rescued) woke up and shared with them his memory of what happened to him
Examining marcus’ memory the party discovers he’d woken up in the cage, interrogated by kenku as to where are the keys and then an elemental myrmidon stole the ruby.

City of Ellinia
Upon arrival to the city the party encounters a stranger who they come to know as Remy
Remy leads them to Cinderbane Manor and to lord Jon Cinderbane III, the benefactor who they met in Goldshire
Jon told then of a quest, they are to search for two missing Stones:
Jon told the party the history of Elinia, long ago 5 warriors defeated a dragon who planned on using the Three Planar Stones to destroy the multiverse.
After the dragon’s defeat the heroes split the Prime stone into the five elemental stones each was given to a hero for safe keeping
Jon Cinderbane I was given the Opal (core)
Marcus Winterclaw was given the Sapphire (water)
Ivon Brightfury was given the Ruby (fire)
Katelyn Earthstrider was given the Citrine (earth)
Elina Grapevine was given the Amethyst (wind)
The Fey stone was given to the fey lords
But the Shadow stone was never recovered and was assumed to be destroyed 
The 5 warriors’ descendants are the 4 major houses (two warriors made a family): Cinderbane, Winterclaw, Brightfury, Earthstrider
The party then went to talk with Lord Brightfury to tell him what happened to his stone but discovered he was on a voyage in his ship orbiting Ellinia so they went after the first of the two stones

Hall of the Dwarf Lord
The party along with Jon’s assistant Remy ventured to find the first stone (Sapphire)
Upon arriving, the party found out that the king was attacked in the mines.
When they rescued the king they discovered that the stone the king was trusted with protecting had been stolen by a cloaked stranger wearing the symbol of the Cult of Ashes.
Lord of Dreams [Side Quest]
That night, the town had been afflicted by a demon, who plunged the whole town to a nightmare. The party battled him but ultimately let him escape. Several of the townsfolk died that night.

Three Trials
Upon reaching the second stone location they found a fey shrine
The party entered the shrine and was confronted by a sacrificial goblet
Trial of Courage
They each sacrificed a drop of blood and a staircase appeared
The party ventured within and battled their way through a dungeon
A Fey nobel appeared and greeted them, gave them a shard of the Emerald and disappeared
Trial of Wisdom
They entered the shrine and made another sacrifice
A path appeared and as they walked through they were brought to a small town
They then solved the mystery of Moonville Manor
When they were transported to outside the shrine again, a fey lord appeared and gave them another shard of the Emerald 
Trial of Power
They once again entered the shrine and made a sacrifice
The walls of the shrine collapsed as they looked around and found themselves in a coliseum surrounded by fey creatures in the stands and other groups around them looking equally confused
They passed the tests of the fey, first they battled the worshipers of tiamat, then they battled githyanki raiders, lastly they battled in a free-for-all arena with orcs and drows
After they emerged victorious they were rewarded by the three lords of the fey courts
They were transported back to the prime material plane
And a call came, Remy told them Jon called something bad happened and the party needs to go now

City of Elinia:
Geography:
The city is located in a crescent valley of the Hesber Mountains along the river Sirya
The river Sirya is a river of mountain spring water flowing north into the Sea of Daggersin the mouth of Syria where porttown was built
The Sirya once ran down the Hesber Mountains towards the Sea of Daggers but when the Geomancers created the valley they changed the flow of the river.
Now the river creates a fall from the springs in the mountains down to the valley lake, continues north-west, under and out of the city via a sewer system called the undercity, the river then continue north to Porttown and the Sea of Daggers
The valley is almost completely flat thanks to the magic of the Geomancers who build the mage tower to focus the power of the leylines crossing
The City is surrounded by the Hesber Mountains themselves and the only entry point to the city is through the Blackwall where the crescent valley opens.
The Blackwall is a massive wall made of black adamantine forged with powerful magic
History
Birth of Ashen
A city was built south of Porttown under the Hylian rule
This city was known as Ashen, later to be renamed Ellinia
Because of the crossing of several ley lines under the city, three wizards wished to harness its power and the king seized the land from the barbarian tribes who used to live there
The three wizards build a tower to focus the power of the ley lines and tore a somewhat stable portal to the astral sea
Attack of Ashen
The city was attacked by a powerful magic wielding dragonlord, known as Charir the Red
5 Champions, later to be known as the Heroes of Ashen, saved the city from the terror with the help of Aurir the gold, Charir’s brother
They were named lords by the king and created Great Houses
The throne didn’t lend a hand in the repairs, so the city was rebuilt thanks by the people of Ashen
Birth of Ellinia
Strict laws against the use of magic were set by the crowned prince since he feared this will happen again with unregulated magic, also higher taxes were placed on the city to repay for all the damaged Charir caused
Ashen a city known for its magical prowess revolted against these regulations, and with the help of Porttown they started a liberation war against the kingdom
The city declared its independence and became a city state, and took under their wing Porttown
Current events 
The Hylian kingdom entered a war with the northerners because of political reasons
Many refugees from the war who wished to leave the kingdom came to Ellinia looking for asylum
Astral raiders (Githyanki) began raiding Xorledo towns
Xorledo requested the assistance of Ellinia’s Skyfleet in exchange for help from the Redcapes in maintaining order because of the refugees

They marched on behalf of the liberated Ashen to the King’s court, and founded the free city of Ellinia

House Brightfury used the two stones in their possession to raise the Skydock and create Ellinia’s airborne fleet
Stuff the party probably forgot:
Marcus Stone’s Memory that dande pulled
In Ellinia
Lord Brightfury: Listen this needs to be a secret, I’ve grown to trust you kid, you’ve worked with my sons and I trust their judgment
Marcus: Not that I don't appreciate the opportunity, it’s an honor to work with a Great Lord of Ellinia, But.. why me? You probably have a personal carrier
Lord BrightfuryLike I said this needs to be a secret, no record and no high personal, nothing too noticeable until this chest reaches Goldshire.. So can I trust you son?
Marcus Yes my lord!
On the Road
Antony: Everything okay back there sir?
Marcus: Don’t worry.. Antony right?
Antony: Yes sir!
Marcus: We passed Graymore a few minutes ago, didn't we? 15 minutes more until Goldshire, if you manage to make it 10 minutes, you’ll find a nice cold beer with your name on it, my treat
Antony: No problem sir
Horses whinny & caravan goes at full speed
Caravan sees to hit a bump and turn
Marcus: Is everything okay?
    Silence
Marcus: Antony?
Caravan sprawls and falls on its side
Marcus: *gets up* what happened there?
Kenkus open the door and hit him with a club on the head
In Kenku Nest, locked in cell
Marcus: *opens his eyes* what’s.. What is going on?
    Sees a Kenku staring at him and two in the back trying to open the chest
Kenku: Give Key!, Where Key?
Marcus: What? I… *Sharp head pain & he blacks out*
Marcus wakes up hearing screams
A Huge flaming creature crawls through the opening,
He goes straight for the chest and slashes it open with one of his scimitars
Marcus blacks out again
